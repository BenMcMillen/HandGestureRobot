# HandGestureRobot
Hand gesture controlled Arduino robot 

# Usage
- Python 3.10.9 is used
- Mediapipe and opencv python libraries are used to deveop the program
- Simply plug arduino into serial port and change the value of the serial port in the fingersensor.py file
- run the python program such (webcam display should open to device)
- Program should now communicate correctly to the arduino
